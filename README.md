<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![getStarted](NeinteenFlowerProject/Assets/ReadMeIMG/getStarted.jpg?raw=true "Title")

NeinteenFlower is a newly established flower shop in Bluejack Land. To start its business, it needs to create a website for their shop. In that website, people can find information about the flowers which NeinteenFlower sells and buy it. This website also allows employees to manage its users and flowers

The layers:
-	View
This layer, or Presentation Layer, is responsible for showing information to the user and interpreting the user's commands. This layer is the home for all user interfaces in the project.
-	Controller
This layer is responsible to validate all input from the view layer. It also responsible for delegating requests from the user to the lower layer for further processing.
-	Handler
This layer is responsible to handle all business logic required in the application. It will delegates the task to query from the database, including select, insert, update and delete, to the repository layer. Please notes that there can be a single handler that accesses multiple repository.  
-	Repository
Repository layer responsible for giving access to the database and model layer via its public interfaces to acquiring references to preexisting domain objects. It provides methods to manipulate the object, such as add and delete, which will encapsulate the actual manipulation operation of data in the data store (or database). Repository also provides methods that select objects based on some criteria and return fully instantiated objects or collection of objects whose attribute meets those criteria.
-	Factory
You need to encapsulate all complex object creation in this layer. For example, when the client needs to create an aggregate object (an object that holds a reference to another object), the object factory must provide an interface for creating these objects. It is important to notes that an object returned by the factory must in a consistent state.
-	Model
The model layer is responsible for representing concepts in the business or information about the business situation.

There are three types of user's roles in this website: Administrator, Member, Employee, and Guest (non-logged in user). Below are the minimum pages you need to create for each role:

- Administrator
    - Manage Member
    - Insert Member
    - Update Member
    - Manage Employee
    - Insert Employee
	Update Employee
-	Member
	Pre Order
	View Transaction History
-	Employee
	Manage Flower
	Insert Flower
	Update Flower
-	Guest
	Login
	Register
	Forgot Password
